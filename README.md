## Test 
This is my first react app built using webpack from scratch. I often bootstrap my projects using create-react-app. I have tried many ways to setup jest and react testing library but unfortunately it still did not work yet. However, you can go to another branch of this repo named [pokemon-app-cra](https://github.com/mahdihrs/pokemon-app/tree/pokemon-app-cra) where I setup few tests.

There are tests that are still failed because I'm still learning how to setup and run the tests in react app.
